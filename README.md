# Network Design: ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY Departments

This project involves designing a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments based on the following specifications:

## Objectives
1. **Department Setup**:
   - Each department should contain at least 2 PCs.
2. **Networking Equipment**:
   - Use an appropriate number of switches and routers in the network.
3. **IP Configuration**:
   - Use the given network address: `192.168.40.0`.
   - Configure all interfaces with appropriate IP addresses, subnet mask, and gateways.
4. **Cabling**:
   - Ensure all devices in the network are connected using appropriate cables.
5. **Connectivity Test**:
   - Verify connectivity between the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.
   - PCs in the DELIVERY department should successfully ping PCs in the ACCOUNTS department.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Deliverables
- A fully functional network topology connecting ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.
- Configured IP addressing and routing.
- Successful connectivity test results (ping).
